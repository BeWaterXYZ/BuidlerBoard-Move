## Core Features

### Developer Rating System

The platform tracks and evaluates developer contributions through:

- GitHub activity data tracking (stars, followers, etc.)
- Comprehensive contribution score calculation
- On-chain rating data recording

#### Rating Dimensions and Weights

| Dimension | Weight | Calculation | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Community Impact | 15pts | [`Math.log10(followers + 1) * 15`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on followers count |
| Project Popularity | 25pts | [`Math.log10(totalStars + 1) * 25`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on total stars received |
| Contribution Activity | 20pts | [`Math.log10(contributions + 1) * 20`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on contribution count |
| Code Contribution | 15pts | [`Math.log10(pullRequests + 1) * 15`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on PR count |
| Problem Solving | 10pts | [`Math.log10(issuesResolved + 1) * 10`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on resolved issues |
| Code Quality | 10pts | [`codeQuality * 10`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on code review score |
| Recent Activity | 5pts | [`recentActivity * 5`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Based on 30-day activity |

### Project Rating System

Project rating uses a multi-dimensional evaluation approach:

| Dimension | Weight | Calculation | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Follower Impact | 15pts | [`Math.log10(followers + 1) * 15`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Project following |
| Star Impact | 35pts | [`Math.log10(totalStars + 1) * 35`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Highest weight indicator |
| Fork Activity | 20pts | [`Math.log10(forks + 1) * 20`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Project reuse value |
| Contributor Scale | 20pts | [`Math.log10(contributions + 1) * 20`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Community activity |
| Recent Activity | 10pts | [`recentActivity * 10`](./src/utils/score-calculator.ts) | Time decay calculation |
